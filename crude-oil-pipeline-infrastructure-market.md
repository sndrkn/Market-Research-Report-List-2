<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crude Oil Pipeline Infrastructure Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transmission</li><li>Gathering</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The crude oil pipeline infrastructure market can be divided into two main types: transmission and gathering. Transmission pipelines are long-distance pipelines that transport crude oil from production areas to refineries or export terminals. They cover vast distances and require large-diameter pipes to accommodate the high volumes of oil. Gathering pipelines, on the other hand, are shorter pipelines that collect crude oil from multiple wells and transport it to a central location for further processing. These pipelines are typically smaller in diameter and serve to consolidate the oil from various sources.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Crude Oil Pipeline Infrastructure Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Onshore</li><li>Offshore</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The crude oil pipeline infrastructure market encompasses both onshore and offshore applications. Onshore pipelines are used for transporting unrefined oil from the production sites to refineries and storage facilities on land. Offshore pipelines, on the other hand, are built under the seabed for transporting oil from offshore drilling platforms to onshore facilities. Both onshore and offshore pipelines play a critical role in the global oil industry, enabling efficient transportation of crude oil across vast distances to meet the energy demand worldwide.</p></p>
