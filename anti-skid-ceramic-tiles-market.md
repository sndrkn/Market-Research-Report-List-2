<p><ul><li>Glazed Tiles</li><li>Whole Body Tiles</li><li>Polishing Tiles</li><li>Vitrified Tiles</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anti-skid ceramic tiles are a specialized type of flooring that provides enhanced safety by preventing slips and falls. The market for these tiles can be categorized into different types based on their characteristics:</p><p>1.

This ensures that even if the surface gets worn out, the anti-skid properties remain intact.</p><p>3. Polishing Tiles: These tiles undergo a polishing process to achieve a reflective and shiny surface. To make them anti-skid, certain additives or surface treatments are applied during manufacturing.</p><p>4. Vitrified Tiles: These tiles are made by mixing clay with silica, quartz, and feldspar at a high temperature to produce a glass-like material. Anti-skid vitrified tiles have additives that provide a rough texture on the surface to prevent slipping.</p><p>5. Other Market: This category includes specialty anti-skid tiles that may have unique features or compositions. These tiles could be developed for specific industrial applications or have specific design patterns to meet different aesthetic requirements.</p></p>
