<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solder Ball Flux Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rosin Flux</li><li>Water Soluble Flux</li><li>No-Clean Flux</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Solder ball flux is a substance used in the soldering process to facilitate the flow of solder and improve the quality of the joint. Three common types of solder ball flux are rosin flux, water-soluble flux, and no-clean flux. Rosin flux is derived from pine trees and leaves a residue that requires post-solder cleaning. Water-soluble flux dissolves in water, making it easy to clean after soldering. No-clean flux leaves behind minimal residue and does not require any cleaning. Each type has its advantages depending on specific soldering requirements.</p></p>
