<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biconical Antennas Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Omni-Directional Antenna</li><li>Directional Antenna</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Biconical antennas are a type of antenna commonly used for radio frequency (RF) signal transmission and reception. They are available in two market types: omni-directional and directional antennas.</p><p>Omni-directional antennas emit and receive RF signals in all directions equally, providing a 360-degree coverage. They are suitable for applications where signals need to be transmitted and received from various directions.</p><p>Directional antennas, on the other hand, focus the RF signals in one specific direction, providing a more concentrated coverage. They are predominantly used in applications where signals need to be transmitted and received in a specific direction or for long-range communications.</p><p>Both omni-directional and directional antennas serve different purposes and cater to different requirements in the biconical antenna market.</p></p>
