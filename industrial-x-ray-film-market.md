<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial X-ray Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Screen Type Films</li><li>Non-Screen Type Films</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Industrial X-ray film is an essential component in non-destructive testing processes. Screen type films contain a layer of fluorescent material that increases the visibility of X-ray images, enabling the detection of flaws in materials. These films are commonly used in applications where low levels of radiation are required. On the other hand, non-screen type films offer higher levels of sensitivity and are preferred in high radiation environments. These films provide clear and detailed X-ray images, making them suitable for industrial fields such as aerospace, automotive, and oil and gas.</p></p>
