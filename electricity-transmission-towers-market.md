<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electricity Transmission Towers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AC</li><li>DC</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Electricity transmission towers are critical infrastructure components that facilitate the transfer of electrical power across long distances. They can be classified into two types based on the kind of current they transmit: AC and DC transmission towers. AC (alternating current) towers transmit electrical power through a bidirectional flow of current that periodically changes direction. DC (direct current) towers, on the other hand, transmit electrical power through a unidirectional flow of current. Both types play a crucial role in the efficient and reliable distribution of electricity across power grids.</p></p>
