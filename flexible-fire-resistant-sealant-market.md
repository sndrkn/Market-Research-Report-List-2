<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flexible Fire Resistant Sealant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastometric Type</li><li>Intumescent Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The flexible fire-resistant sealant market includes two main types of sealants: elastomeric and intumescent. Elastomeric sealants have the ability to stretch and recover their shape, making them suitable for dynamic joint movement. They provide excellent heat resistance and are commonly used in industrial settings. Intumescent sealants, on the other hand, expand when exposed to high temperatures, forming a heat-insulating char layer that prevents the spread of fire. These sealants are often used in buildings to provide fire protection and maintain structural integrity.</p></p>
